# BERT-QuestionAnswer-API-Installer-WIN
Probably the most stupidest thing you'll see today, (It's not much but it's honest work :"). This is the shitty installer for WINDOWS to install BERT-QuestionAnswer-API which you can find here https://github.com/akashdeepb/BERT-QuestionAns-API.git


### HOW TO RUN
DOUBLE CLICK ON installer (yup, that should be it)

Don't forget, it'll only work on Window (if it'll work)
